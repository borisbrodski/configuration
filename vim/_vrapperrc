" If set, search results will be highlighted
set hlsearch

" This setting changes the behavior of the hlsearch setting to restrict it to a number of editors. Whereas Vim will always quickly highlight the current search across all windows and tabs, in Vrapper this might take quite some time and resources. To tune the performance, the following values are supported:
"   clear - Only one editor can have active highlighting. Switching might change the highlighting if an editor gets reloaded, but normally the highlighting only changes if running a search in the current active editor.
"   local - Each editor gets its own highlighting, Vrapper will not clear or update it if doing anything in another editor.
"   window - All editors in the current window will use the same highlighting except for those which have noglobalregisters set (those use a local search register).
" Note that the above might behave weirdly if you open fresh editors or switch to an editor from your last session. This is a known issue and will be improved in due time.
